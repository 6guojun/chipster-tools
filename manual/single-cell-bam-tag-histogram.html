<h2>BAM tag histogram</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This DropÂ­-seq tool extracts reads per cell barcode (=the number of reads for XC tag in a BAM file).
Based on these, a cumulative distribution plot is drawn. This plot can be used to estimate how many cells you want
to extract from your BAM in the DGE matrix: the "knee" of the distribution shows this. 
The number of STAMPs are the number of cell barcodes to the left of the inflection point (the "knee"); 
to the right of the inflection point are the empty beads that have only been exposed to ambient RNA.
