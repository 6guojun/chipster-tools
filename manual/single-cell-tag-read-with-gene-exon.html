<h2>Tag read with gene exon</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This Drop-seq tool adds a BAM tag GE to reads which overlap an exon of a gene. This tag contains the gene name, as reported in the GTF genome annotation file. </p>
 

<p>
For more details, please check the <a href="http://mccarrolllab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Drop-seqAlignmentCookbookv1.2Jan2016.pdf/">Drop-seq manual.</a>
</p>


<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
		<li>Organism [other]</li>
	</ul>
Chipster provides Ensembl-based GTF files for many organisms in the pull-down menu. If you would like to use your own GTF, set the organism parameter to other and check that your GTF file has been correctly assigned in the parameter panel.


<h3>Output</h3>

<ul>
<li>merged_tagged.bam: BAM file where reads overlapping an exon are tagged with gene name. </li>
</ul>
