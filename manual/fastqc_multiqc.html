<h2>Read quality with MultiQC for many FASTQ files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool runs FastQC on multiple FASTQ files, and then combines the reports using MultiQC.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Input file is a single Tar package containing the FASTQ files you want to analyze. FASTQ files can be gzipped. The Tar package itself can be 
gzipped, but it should be noted that if the individual FASTQ files are already compressed, compressing the Tar package will 
not make it any smaller.
</p>
<p>
You can make a Tar package of your FASTQ files using the Utilities tool Make a tar package.
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
An html report with plots and tables produced by the analysis modules. Please note that you have to select the visualization 
option "Open in external browser" or "Open in new tab".
</p>

<h3>Reference</h3>
