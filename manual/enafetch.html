<h2>Retrieve Data from ENA database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool retrieves data from the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">ENA database</a> based on the ID of a data set.
The data retrieval and processing is done with the <a href="https://github.com/enasequence/enaBrowserTools">enaDataGet<a> 
program.</p><p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
To be able to use this tool, you must know the ENA ID of the data set you wish to retrieve. 
As ENA stores data in many different levels and formats, the files retrieved form ENA may be 
in different formats depending on the data type that the ID refers to. In most cases you can 
use defaultÂ the format proposed by the enaDataGet program, but if you are retrieving NGS reads 
data you should explicitly define the data format to be fastq, as the SRA format, that is the 
default option, can't be used in Chipster.

As the ENA data sets can be very large, downloading the data can take a long time.
