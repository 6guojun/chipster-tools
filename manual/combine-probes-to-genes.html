<h2>Combine probes to genes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool takes a normalized dataset, and combines all probes that have been mapped to the same
gene name into a single expression estimate for that gene. Probes are averaged together to get a 
single estimate of expression.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>-</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Please note, that summarizing multiple probes for a given gene (or
multiple probe-sets for an Affy array) is <a href="https://support.bioconductor.org/p/44161/">not recommended</a>  as a routine
procedure by any of the Bioconductor software developers. 
By combining the expression information you lose the probe/probeset wise information resulting for example
from different isoforms being present in the samples. </p>

<p>Note that some of the pathway analysis tools require the probe IDs to work 
-you can however use "Hypergeometric test 
for ConsensusPathDB" as it supports any data with gene symbols.</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A new, smaller dataset with only one expression value per gene per sample.
