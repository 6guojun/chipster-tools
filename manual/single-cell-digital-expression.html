<h2>Digital expression</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This Drop­-seq tool extracts the digital gene expression data from an aligned library.
<br>
There are two outputs available: 
<br>-the primary is the DGE matrix, with each a row for each gene, and a column for each cell
<br>-the secondary analysis is a summary of the DGE matrix on a per ­cell level, 
indicating the number of genes and transcripts observed.
</p>

<p>
<b>The selection of the sets of cells</b> <br>
<ul>
		<li>Number of barcodes: Counts the number of reads per cell barcode and only includes cells that 
		have at least this many reads.</li>
		li>Number of genes per cell: Select cells that have at least this many genes.</li>
 </p>
