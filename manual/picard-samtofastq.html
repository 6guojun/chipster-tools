<h2>BAM to FASTQ</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This Picard-tool converts the BAM file into FASTQ file. 
The tool extracts read sequences and base quality scores from the input SAM/BAM file and outputs them in FASTQ format.
This needs to be done so that the unaligned reads can be aligned (aligners take only FASTQ as input). </p>


<p>
For more details, please check the <a href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html/">home page of Picard tools.</a>
