<h2>Utilities / Make a list of file names</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Makes a list of file names of the selected files.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>File name for list (String) [files.txt]</li>
<li>Sort (yes, no) [yes]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Some Chipster tools (<i>e.g.</i> Tophat2 and Cuffdiff2) require a list of file names to assign input files to
correct inputs. This tool will produce a suitable list file for those tools.
</p>
<p>By default the list is sorted in alphabetical order. This is done so that if you have <i>e.g.</i> two lists for matching read pairs,
the read pairs are listed in identical order in both lists.  If your files are named so that the sorted order is not correct, you can 
set <strong>Sort: no</strong> and select the files one by one in the correct order.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The output is a text file.
