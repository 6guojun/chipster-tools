<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>FastQC examines reads for base quality and distribution, duplicates, length, over-represented k-mers, etc. GZip compressed fastq files are automatically detected and unzipped. 

For a detailed description of the plots, please see the <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/">FastQC manual</a>.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
