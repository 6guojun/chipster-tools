<h2>Extract unique sequences</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a fasta file and groups file, removes identical sequences from the fasta file.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

None

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Many sequences are identical and it would be computationally wasteful to align the same sequence many times later. It is therefore
better to keep only one representative sequence in the fasta file, and keep track of how many sequences it represents and store this info in a count_table file. 
Alternatively we could list the names of each represented sequence, but this names file would be very large as sequence names are long.
Based on Mothur tool unique.seqs and count.seqs.

<p>
This tool is based on the <a href="http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Unique.seqs">Unique.seqs</a> and 
<a href="http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Unique.seqs">Count.seqs</a> commands of the Mothur package.
</p>




<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The analysis output consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>unique.fasta: Unique sequences</li> 
<li>unique.summary.tsv: Summary statistics for the sequences </li> 
<li>unique.count_table = how many represented sequences are in each sample </li>
</ul>
