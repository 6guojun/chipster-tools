<h2>Concatenate files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool writes the content of the selected files into one new file. 
The input and output files are treated as text files that are just dumped into
one result file. No data processing or format conversion is done.
</p><p>
Note that there are several file formats that are not compatible with this 
kind of direct file merging (e.g. pdf, bam and index files). If you set the
file extension explicitly, you can enforce the concatenation for any file 
types but the resulting file may not be usable for other Chipster tools.
</p>
<p>
Note that you can use this tool for just one file too to change the name 
extension of the file.
