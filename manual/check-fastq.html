<h2>Quality control / Check FASTQ file for errors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Checks a FASTQ file for common errors.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>
None
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The tool  does some simple tests to validate a FASTQC file:
<ol>
<li>Check that the number of lines in file is divisible by four</li>
<li>For each read check that the number of sequence letters and the number of quality values match</li>
<li>Check for duplicated sequence identifier lines</li>
</ol>
Tests 1 and 2 are mainly meant to spot files that are truncated in transfer or otherwise. Test 3 
can spot instances where FASTQ files have been concatenated, and one or more files have been added 
more than once by mistake.
</p>

<p>
Please note that the tool is not guaranteed to find all errors. It does not, for example, check for 
non-permitted characters in sequences and quality values. It is intended to be a simple and relatively fast
tool to spot some common problems that can occur in file transfer or manipulation.
<P>
For more in-depth analysis use one the more comprehensive quality checking tools such as "Read quality with FastQC".
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
A log file with details of any found problems is generated for each FASTQ file. Log files for files with no problems are named
&#42;_PASS.log. If any of the tests fails, the file is named &#42;_FAIL.log.
</p>
