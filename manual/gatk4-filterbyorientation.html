<h2>GATK4 -Filter Mutect2 calls by orientation bias</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Additionally filter Mutect2 somatic variant calls for sequence context-dependent artifacts, e.g. OxoG or FFPE deamination.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Artifacts on the forward strand (String) []</li>
</ul>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Additionally filter Mutect2 somatic variant calls for sequence context-dependent artifacts, e.g. OxoG or FFPE deamination.
</p>
<p>
This tool is complementary to FilterMutectCalls and if run, should be run after FilterMutectCalls. The tool requires 
the pre-adapter detailed metrics calculated by Picard CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics and specification of the base 
substitution(s) to consider for orientation bias. For a given base substitution specified with the --artifact-modes 
argument, the tool considers both the forward and reverse complement for filtering. That is, specifying --artifact-modes 
'G/T' means the tool considers G to T and A to C artifacts for filtering.
</p>
<p>
The metrics from CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics give a global view across a sample's genome that empowers decision 
making in ways site-specific analyses cannot. The detailed metrics measure orientation bias for all three-base contexts 
and help determine whether variant filtering for a sequence context is necessary.
</p>
<p>
The most common artifact to consider for filtering is the OxoG (8-Oxoguanine) artifact. OxoG artifacts stem from oxidation 
of guanine to 8-oxoguanine, which results in G to T transversions. If samples were derived from histological slides, then 
consider the FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) artifact. FFPE artifacts stem from formaldehyde deamination of cytosines, 
which results in C to T transitions.
