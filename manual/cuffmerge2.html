<h2>RNA-seq / Merge transcript assemblies with Cuffmerge</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool merges transcript assemblies with Cuffmerge.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
Exclude transcripts with duplicate ids (yes, no) [no]
<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Given several transcript GTF files obtained by Cufflinks, Cuffmerge merges them into one. 
The merged GTF file can be used in differential expression analysis with Cuffdiff.
</p>
<p>
Cufflinks produces sometimes GTF files which contain duplicate transcript identifiers. In this case Cuffmerge will terminate and produce a log file reporting the problem.
You can exclude duplicate identifiers by turning the parameter on. This way Cuffmerge will produce a merged GTF file and report in the log file how many transcripts were removed from each input file.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
<p>The analysis output consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>merged.gtf: A GTF file that contains an assembly that merges together the input assemblies.</li>
<li>cuffmerge.log: A log file containing possible error messages or the number of excluded transcripts.</li>
</ul>
</p>
