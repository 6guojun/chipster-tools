<h2>Produce species count table and phenodata</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool generates a count table and a phenodata file, which you can use to assign samples to different experimental groups 
for further statistical analysis. 
The input for the tool is a read taxonomy assignment file that can be created with the tool 
<a href="/manual/mothur-classifyseqs.html">Classify sequences to taxonomic units</a>, and a group file. 
NOTE that the tool doesn't currently take Mothur's count_table file, so the taxons are shown only for the representative sequences (unless you have classified all sequences). 
This will be improved in September 2018, when we will also add the Mothur pipeline for producing OTU-table (dist.seqs – cluster, using opticlust - make.shared - classify.otu).
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

Cutting level for taxonomic names in count table (0-9) [0] 

<h3>Details</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The analysis output consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>counttable.tsv: Count table where rows are samples and columns are taxonomic groups </li> 
<li>phenodata.tsv: Phenodata file allowing the user to assign samples to experimental groups </li> 
</ul>
