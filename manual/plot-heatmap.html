<h2>Heatmap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Visualizes the grouping of samples or genes as a static heatmap image. If you would like to have an interactive heatmap which scales well and allows to select genes,
please run the tool "Clustering / Hierachical" and double-click on the result file hc.tre.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Coloring scheme (Red-Green, Blue-Yellow, Black-White) [Blue-Yellow]</li>
<li>Scale (default, none, row, column) [default]</li>
<li>Distance (euclidean, maximum, manhattan, canberra, binary, pearson, spearman, kendall) [pearson]</li>
<li>Cluster samples only (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Image width (200-3200) [600]</li>
<li>Image height (200-3200) [600]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>First both samples and genes are clustered using Pearson correlation as a distance measure
and average linkage for constructing the dendrogram. These clusterings are then visualized 
as a heatmap, where every gene is colored according to its expression level. Please note that while this tool can be applied to a dataset containing up 20 000 genes/samples, the text doesn't scale accordingly. For large data sets it is recommended to use
 the "Clustering / Hierachical " tool instead.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A pdf containing the heatmap:</p>
