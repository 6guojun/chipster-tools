</ul>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

You must define the Illumina BasesSpade API server and your personal access token for every task.
The data sets are identified by their names (id code is not accepted). In the case of data set listing,
the name parameter is ignored and can be left blank. 


<h3>Obtaining server name and access token for Illumina BaseSpace</h3>

To create the Access Token you must have access to computer that has 
<a href="https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/docs/content/documentation/cli/cli-overview"> bs client installed</a>.
You can easily install <i>bs client</i> to your local computer or if you have CSC account, you can use
the <a href="https://research.csc.fi/-/illumina-basespace">bs client installed in taito.csc.fi</a>.

The access token is created with bs setup command:
<pre>
bs -auth
</pre>
<p>The command prints out a link, that you should paste to a browser program to verify your authentication.
After the authentication, Illumina BaseSpace configuration file is created to your home directory 
in the computer where you executed the <i>bs -auth</i> command. This configuration file contains information about the 
server name and access token you should use.
</p><p>
In Taito, you can print out the content of the configuration file with command:
<pre>cat $HOME/.basespace/default.cfg</pre>

<p>
Note, that you need to set the access token for BassSpace only once. However you must include the access token 
to every BaseSpace command in Chipster, as Chipster does not store the access token information.
