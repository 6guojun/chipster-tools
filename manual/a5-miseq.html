<h2>A5 assembly pipeline for microbial genomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Construct small genomes based on the Illumina MiSeq data.</p>


<p>This tool runs A5-miseq pipeline that is designed for assembling DNA 
sequence data generated on the Illumina sequencing platform. There are many 
situations where A5-miseq is not the right tool for the job. In order to 
produce accurate results, A5-miseq requires Illumina data with certain characteristics. 
A5-miseq will likely not work well with Illumina reads shorter than around 80 nt, or reads 
where the base qualities are low in all or most reads before 60 nt. A5-miseq 
assumes it is assembling homozygous haploid genomes. Use a different 
assembler for metagenomes and heterozygous diploid or polyploid organisms. 
Use a different assembler if a tool like FastQC reports your data quality is 
dubious. 
</p>
<p>
The tool needs a pair of fastq formatted paired-end reads files.
