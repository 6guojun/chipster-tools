<h2>Seurat -Find conserved cluster markers and DE genes in two samples </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool gives you
<ul>
 <li> The cell type markers that are conserved across conditions (conserved_markers.tsv)</li> and 
<li> The differentially expressed genes between the conditions (de-list.tsv) </li>
</ul>
for a given cluster. "Conditions" are the ones determined in the Setup tool with the Sample or group name parameter.
This tool can be used for two sample combined Seurat objects.
</p>
 
 <h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
		<li>Name of the cluster [3]</li>
		<li>Only return positive conserved markers [TRUE]</li>
		<li>Threshold for logFC of conserved markers [1]</li>
		<li>Threshold for adjusted p-value of conserved markers [0.05]</li>
</ul>
	
	
 <h3>Details</h3>
  
<p>
As inputs, give the combined Seurat object. <br>
</p>

<p>
Select the cluster you want to inspect by setting its name in the parameter field. As an example, the parameter is
set to cluster "3".
</p>

<p>
You can filter the conserved markers using the parameters. By default, only positive markers with
logFC > 1 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 are listed in the table.
</p>


<p>
<b>de-list.tsv</b> is a table containing the differentially expressed genes for the chosen cluster, compared
to all the other cells in the data, and associated statistics: 
<ul>
	<li><b>p-val</b> = p-values for the differentially expressed genes (larger the p-value -> higher the 
	likelihood that the gene is in the list just be chance) </li>
	<li><b>avg_logFC</b> = average log fold change (how much higher (lower) the expression of this gene is in the chosen
	cluster, compared to all the other cells </li>
	<li><b>pct.1</b> = what percentage of the cells in the chosen cluster show some expression for this gene</li>
	<li><b>pct.2</b> = what percentage of the cells <b>not</b> in the chosen cluster (=all the other cells) show some expression for this gene</li>
	<li><b>p-val_adj</b> = adjusted/corrected p-value. This value is multiple testing corrected: 
	when we test over thousands of genes, we would statistically start getting some significantly differentially
	expressed genes just by chance. There are different methods to correct for this, 
	here a <i>Bonferroni</i> correction is used. When filtering the table and reporting your results, 
	use this value.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>conserved_markers.tsv</b> is a table containing a ranked list of conserved markers in the chosen cluster (=genes that show changes in 
expression in this particular cell type/cluster, regardless of the treatment/sample),
and associated statistics: 
<ul>
	<li>the values listed above for both samples in the data </li>
	<li> max_p-val = maximum p-value of the two samples (note: not looking at the adjusted p-values)</li>
	<li> min_p-val = minimum p-value of the two samples (note: not looking at the adjusted p-values)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>

<ul>
<li>conserved_markers.tsv: Conserved cell type markers across the conditions </li>
<li>de-list.tsv: Differentially expressed genes between the conditions </li>
