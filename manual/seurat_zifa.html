<h2>ZIFA, Zero Inflated Factor Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Zero-inflated dimensionality reduction algorithm for single-cell data. This version is compatible with the Seurat pipeline.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3> 
<ul>
<li>How many latent dimensions is wanted. [3]</li>
<li>Filters out genes that are zero in more than this proportion of samples (0-1) [0.95]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
ZIFA is a dimensionality-reduction method for single-cell data. It explicitly models the dropout characteristics. There are two versions of ZIFA "normal" and block.
 The block version is recommended when there are more than a few thousand genes.</p>

<p>Runtime for block ZIFA on the full single-cell dataset from Pollen et al, 2014 (~250 samples, ~20,000 genes) is approximately 15 minutes on a quadcore Mac Pro.
Runtime for block ZIFA is roughly linear in the number of samples and the number of genes, and quadratic in the block size. Decreasing the block size may decrease runtime but will also produce less reliable results.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
This tool returns the following files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ZIFAplots.pdf: Visualizations from the results: Top genes associated with latent dimension, the cells in the first two latent dimensions, heatmap focusing on a latent dimension, and the standard deviations of the latent dimension.</li>
<li>ZIFAgenes.txt: A set of genes that most stronly define a set of latent dimensions</li>
<li>seurat_obj_2.Robj: A R object that has the ZIFA's results saved into PCA slots. This object can be used in the Seurat pipeline as if it was produced by PCA.</li>

</ul>
