<h2>Directional RNA-seq data -which parameters to choose? </h2>

<p>Directional RNA-seq methods are gaining popularity.  Several protocols and products are available 
for the library preparation step, and different tools and softwares have different options to take 
these into account.  Since this has caused a lot of confusion due to incoherent parameter naming, 
we try to clarify this issue a bit here.</p>

<p>To be able to select the right parameters for your data, first you need to know which library prep 
method was used when generating your data.  In general, there are three types of library preps: 
<ul> 
<li>un-stranded </li>
<li>"second-strand" = directional, where the first read of the read pair 
(or in case of single end reads, the only read) is from the transcript strand  </li>
<li>"first-strand" = directional, where the first read (or the only read in case of SE) is from the opposite strand. 
</li> </ul>
</p>

<p><b>Be extra careful to assign the files correctly in TopHat!</b> Using these parameters assumes you are giving the 
files in specific order: read1, read2. In Chipster always check from the parameters window that your 
files are assigned correctly. 
</p>

<p><b>Why is this so important? </b>If you use wrong directionality parameter, in the read counting step 
the reads are considered to be from the wrong strand. This means that in the cases where there 
are no genes on that other strand, you won't get any hits, and if there are genes in the same 
location on the other strand, your reads are counted for that wrong gene. 
</p>

<p><b>How can I check I chose correctly? </b>It's a good idea to check that!  <br>
<b>In Tophat:</b> Check the mapping rate after the TopHat alignment (in Chipster, open file tophat-summary.txt). 
Note that you can 
run TopHat with the different parameters to a small part of the data and then compare the results. <br>
<b>In HTSeq:</b> Check the number of reads that are not counted for any gene (=the "no-feature reads").  
(In Chipster, open file htseq-count-info.txt). 
</p>

<p>Below we list some common library preparation kits and their corresponding parameters 
in different tools. <b>PLEASE NOTE</b> that the kits are listed in the different categories based 
on our best understanding, so please inform us if you discover something more.</p>

<p><b><u> Unstranded: </u></b><br>
Information regarding the strand is not conserved 
(it is lost during the amplification of the mRNA fragments). <br>
<b>Kits: </b> <br>
TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit <br>
<b>Parameters:</b> <br>
TopHat / Cufflinks / Cuffdiff: library-type fr-unstranded <br>
HTSeq: stranded -- no <br> </p>

<p><b><u>Directional, first strand:</u></b><br>
The second read (read 2) is from the original RNA strand/template, first read (read 1) is from the 
opposite strand.
The information of the strand is preserved as the original RNA strand is degradated due to the 
dUTPs incorporated in the second synthesis step.<br>
<b>Kits:</b> <br>
All dUTP methods, NSR, NNSR<br>
TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit<br>
TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit<br>
NEB Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit <br>
Agilent SureSelect Strand-Specific (as far as we understand) <br>
<b>Parameters:</b><br>
TopHat / Cufflinks / Cuffdiff: library-type fr-firststrand<br>
HTSeq: stranded -- reverse<br> </p>

<p><b><u>Directional, second strand:</u></b><br>
The first read (read 1) is from the original RNA strand/template, second read (read 2) is from the 
opposite strand.
The directionality is preserved, as different adapters are ligated to different ends of the fragment. <br>
<b>Kits:</b><br>
Directional Illumina (Ligation), Standard SOLiD<br>
ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (as far as we understand)<br>
EncoreÂ® Complete RNA-Seq Library Systems (as far as we understand)<br>
<b>Parameters:</b><br>
TopHat / Cufflinks / Cuffdiff: library-type fr-secondstrand<br>
HTSeq: stranded -- yes<br></p>

<p>Note also that the --fr/--rf/--ff or "Order of mates to align" parameter in Bowtie has similar 
sounding parameter options: [--fr: "Forward/reverse", --rf: "Reverse/Forward", --ff: "Forward/forward"]. 
However, these parameters are a bit different story, as they explain how the paired end reads are 
oriented towards each other (-> <-, -> -> or <- ->).  The default (--fr, -> <-) is appropriate for 
Illumina's paired-end reads: it means that read 1 appears upstream of the reverse complement of read 2, 
or vice versa.  When running TopHat, the library-type parameter is delivered to Bowtie, so the 
user doesn't have to worry about that too much.</p>
