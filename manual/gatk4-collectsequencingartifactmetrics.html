<h2>GATK4 -Generate sequencing artifact metrics for filtering by orientation bias</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Generate sequencing artifact metrics for filtering by orientation bias with GATK4
</p>


<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reference sequence () [human]</li>
<li>Chromosome names in my BAM file look like (1, chr1) [chr1]</li>
</ul>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Collect metrics to quantify single-base sequencing artifacts. 
</p>
<p>
Quantify substitution errors caused by mismatched base pairings during various stages of sample / library prep. 
We measure two distinct error types - artifacts that are introduced before the addition of the read1/read2 
adapters ("pre adapter") and those that are introduced after target selection ("bait bias"). For each of 
these, we provide summary metrics as well as detail metrics broken down by reference context (the ref 
bases surrounding the substitution event). For a deeper explanation, see Costello et al. 2013: 
<a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23303777">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23303777</a> 
</p>
<p>
Based on GATK4 CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics (Picard) tool. For more detailed information, see <a href = "https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_analysis_artifacts_CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics.php">GATK documentation</a>,

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Artifact metrics file</li>
</ul>
